"Demons are nimble and quite tough creatures, who don't need armor or "
"clothing to protect themselves from physical damage. Nevertheless, their "
"appearance resembles that of a human. Most of them carry some kind of "
"weapon, although their claws and ability to throw fireballs at their enemies "
"usually fit better their purpose of seeking suffering and blood in their "
"opponents."

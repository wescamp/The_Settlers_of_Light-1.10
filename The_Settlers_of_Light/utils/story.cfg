		story= _ "This story will be narrated from the perspective an anonymous character which a (not so) surprising reveal later on will... reveal... that the narrator is actually one of the playable characters in the game (I promise to try my best to make it interesting). He'll tell you about how a war erupted between the Aragwaith people and the Chaos Empire around the time of the mysterious and sudden appearance of elves at the Aragwaithi border (See IftU for details). Naturally the war started off pretty bad for the Aragwaithi, as evil empires do tend to be quite powerful, and have left a great number people along the borders even more poor and homeless then they were before. The difficulty of the unfortunate peasants is compounded by an apathetic aristocracy that seems incapable of both feeding and protecting them not that they did much of either before the war; I think you can see where this is going. "

	[part]
		story= _ "No, they don't rise up in revolt (I'm not that clever ;P). Instead they pack up and decide to follow a priest, the sole prophet of a recently forged cult for the oh so mysterious 'Lords of light' (bonus points for original name), out of their ancestral homes and into the desert to escape both the war and their corrupt feudal government. Meanwhile a band of soldiers, under the leadership of their most daring commrade, turn on their lord and kill him after he tried to force them to stand and die against a horde of Chaos Legionaries. To cover their crime, the band of soldiers walk about claiming to be an old mercenary company just coming off of a recent contract from some obscure lord (I wanted to make a campaign dealing with mercenaries so just deal with it). Though the war is enough of a destraction to keep the council off their tracks the mercenary captain knows it won't last so he meets with the leaders of the refugees and makes a deal with (the devil.. I mean) the prophet. He contracts out the company's services, agreeing to safely escort the peasants out of the north and then through the wastelands to the coast. "

"During most of the Golden Age, the humans who inhabited the Great Continent "
"were mostly Wesnothians, divided across various territories such as the "
"Northlands, Elensefar and the kingdom of Wesnoth itself. However, there was "
"once a time of great strife during which a new race of humans started to "
"appear from nowhere. They were the 'Aragwaithi', which meant 'noble' in "
"their native language.\n"
"\n"
"It has been since then rumored that they came from the Vast Sea to settle in "
"Wesnoth. They mostly lived as mercenaries in that time, until the Fall. "
"After that, they supposedly moved to the northmost lands of the Continent, "
"were the sands could not reach, and the green could survive.\n"
"\n"
"Albeit being humans, many of their customs and racial features are "
"incredibly different to the standards, to the point it puts them close to "
"elves in terms of their dexterity with bows. Their wisemen have a mastery of "
"magic not to be underestimated in the battlefield, for it has surprised and "
"overseded the best magi often."

"Argazars lost control over their creations -- or, rather, their creations "

"\n"
"Without the direction of the Argazars, the instincts of the shaxthals "

"their biological ancestors and the warfare programming of their artificial "
"bodies. Those instincts eventually drove them them to consume the remainins "

"integrated them into their own buiomechanical plan. For they had been "
"designed with an assimilation system that allowed them to integrate into new "
"environments, or adapt the environments themselves to suit their needs, "
"including any living organisms that might inhabit them.\n"
"\n"
"The Shaxthals kept most of the technology of the Argazars, losing magic and "
"the advanced forms of biomanipulation with which they had been created. "
"Reduced to barely a few dozen, the Argazars figured out a biological "
"weakness of their creations, a way to destroy most of the Shaxthals en "
"masse. All but a few of the strongest shaxthals perished. Fatefully, the "
"Argazars decided to keep them in cryogenic pods instead of destroying them "
"forever, as they thought there might be a last hope of using reprogrammed "
"shaxthals to rebuild their civilization at some point in the future. That "
"foolish thought was almost condemned the Great Continent to an armageddon "
"millennia later.\n"
"\n"
"Long after the Fall of Wesnoth, the self-proclaimed Emperor of Chaos figured "
"out a way to resurrect the creatures, and reproduce their technology by "
"artificial means. The chaos mages of the Empire even enabled them to them "
